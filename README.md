Magazine style vector based site. I hate it. Enjoy.

Simple, easy to navigate with central navigation, interesting to browse, and low data costs. SVG vector graphics only. That's sort of what I have envisioned for these types of sites. Not super well documented but should be okay to follow. MC line is marked. You can lower the number of stars for faster performance if needed (change populateStars,.) Using Inkscape for vector graphics creation and scanning. 

Need to fix scale on android vs iphone devices.
